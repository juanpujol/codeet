# Codeet

Is an external code editor based on [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/). It will allow you to open code snippets *hosted on your own server* for quick updates.

## How it works?

The concept is very easy actually. Codeet works sending and receiving javascript messages. This nifty little feature allows to have a cross-browser communication between the editor and your project.

To connect with code and be able to open and save you will need to host the (codeet-client) library.
